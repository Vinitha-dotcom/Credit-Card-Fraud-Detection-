# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project  

## Objective  
Develop a machine learning pipeline to accurately identify fraudulent credit card transactions, balancing precision and recall to minimize financial risks.  

## Key Steps  

### 1. Data Preprocessing  
- Standardized the `Amount` feature using `StandardScaler`.  
- Checked and verified no missing values.  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Visualized class distribution and transaction amounts.  
- Reduced dimensions using PCA for clustering analysis.  

### 3. Feature Engineering  
- Conducted thorough dataset analysis to enhance model performance.  

### 4. Model Building  
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.  
- Trained models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors, XGBoost.  

### 5. Evaluation and Results  
- Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score.  
- **XGBoost**: Best model with balanced performance.  
- **Decision Tree**: Strong recall.  
- **kNN**: High precision.  

### 6. Conclusion  
The XGBoost model was the most effective, with Decision Tree and kNN providing specific advantages for recall and precision, respectively.
